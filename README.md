# 566-final

Progress thus far:
I have set up the biome system and the data structures per biome (store neighbor polygons, edges, and vertices)
Still need to do:
1). populate those data structs
2). assign color to the biomes
3). add noise to biomes to deforem the shapes + edges
4). implement erosion
